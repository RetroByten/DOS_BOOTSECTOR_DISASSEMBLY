BOOTSECT.BIN - Dumped Binary Boot Sector from PC-DOS 2.1 installed on an SD-Cart JR from a PCJr
BOOTSECT.HTM - Ghidra disassembly export in HTML
BOOTSECT.ASM - Assembleable (MASM 2.0) compatible boot sector based on the disassembly.
	- Note: this assembles byte-for-byte *except* it pads the initial 0-7bff addresses with 0s before the 512
	bytes of the boot sector, don't yet know how to get MASM to not do this but it is easy to discard them.
